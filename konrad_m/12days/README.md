Project Name: 

    BillGasm  

Project Description:

    I was disappointed with my Hackathon project. I still wanted to create a website that was basic, functional, somewhat polished and on Heroku so I could show my friends and family what I am learning at DevPoint. I created BillGasm with these goals in mind. I feel I met my basic objectives.

    This is the most polished project I've created to date. It's reasonably easy to use and isn't totally ugly. In addition to the basic CRUD features which should be pretty apparent to the user, be sure to check out the different sorting options and the stats page.

## Challenges

- What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome them? Be candid.
    The most challenging and time consuming aspect of the project was in the polishing. I spent a dissproportionate amount of time tinkering with the styling and trying to craft a decent looking page. I also had some small setbacks with getting the site live on heroku and dealing with some irritating issues with custom fonts and backgrounds.

- Based on this project, what do you want to learn more of?
    Um... Everything. I can't think of anything that I wouldn't benefit from learning more of. For the sake of better time management, I should probably improve on my bootstrap and css skills.
